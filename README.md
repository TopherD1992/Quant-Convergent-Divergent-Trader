Multi-KPI Market Analytics for Detection and Differentiating Normal &amp; Hidden Convergences + Divergences for Market Reversals vs Retracements
Need to Query Time-Series Data, can use arbitrary trading pair (C1/USD) for continuous WTI Futures and USD pairing (arbitrary test data) for CVS file

Need to determine time series fit, probably best to portion out data by zones as a baseline performance to measure up to the Machine Learning Non-Linear Semi-emerical method of model fitting for price vs. time. 
NN == Neural Network 
Might have to have Neural Network use a non-liner fit, or decide to go with non-emperical equation model to determine forecasts.

KPIs for Consideration:

RSI is a 2 moving averages of the data's KPI
Stoch RSI is a derivative of that function
MACD (Is there a limit to computing latency, past computing all these KPIs?
